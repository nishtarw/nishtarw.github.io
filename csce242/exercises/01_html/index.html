    <h1>The Ocean</h1>
    <p>Oceans are one of the most vast and deepest bodies of water on earth. They cover over 70% of the Earth's surface. The ocean is like the heart of the earth, regulating the climate. It is home to so many living beings from the smallest plants to the biggest creatures such as whales.   </p>
    
    <p>The ocean takes up majority of earth but only 5% discovered, which means the 95% is still a mystery. So much is still undiscovered and the biggest wonder. The 5 main oceans are the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic Oceans. Each region has unique qualities.</p>
