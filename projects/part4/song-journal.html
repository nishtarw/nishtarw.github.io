                    <p>
                        Giving this song a 8/10. This song by The Weeknd is definitely one of my favorites from the album. The lyrics feel incredibly raw, and his vocals are so captivating. I love the concept of the trilogy, with this albulm being the first, symbolizing his death and the deep regrets that come with it. The catchy instrumental adds an extra layer that makes it even more enjoyable.</p>

                    <p>Giving this song a 7/10. I love the concept of the song because it feels relatable to me and many others out there. I love that the lyrics are so honest and her voice is beautiful. Wanting to be your true self but still be considered a "normal girl".</p>

                    <h3>My Review</h3>
                    <p>10/10. This is my go-to crying song. It features the most beautiful instrumentation and the most angelic voice I’ve ever heard—though that’s true for most of their songs. The vocals are ethereal, and whenever the song mentions "cry" or hits the bridge, it really pulls at your heartstrings. It’s perfect for a sad day or moments of reflection.</p>
